Provides a sidebar widget containing links to posts with a similar set of tags to the current post.

== Description ==

The similar posts which are displayed are posts whose tag sets are similar to the tag set of the current post.

The widget displays on single pages only.

For example, if a post has the tags "foo", "bar", and "baz", and there are other posts in the system with the same tags, those posts will be displayed. If there are not posts that have all three, but some with two of the three, those will be displayed. The sort order for posts with the same number of matching tags is date.

Also allows the list of related posts to be added to the end of posts, or of posts in the RSS feed.

== Installation ==

*PHP 5 is required.*

1. Download and unzip the plugin into your WordPress plugins directory.
1. Activate the plugin on your Admin Plugins page.
1. Adjust the widget settings on your Admin Widgets page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

*How can I hide the datestamps next to the related posts?*

In the widget settings, set the date format to blank.

*How can I show the list at the end of posts (in RSS or on single pages) without having the widget in my sidebar?*

Put the widget in your sidebar, check the checkbox for adding the list to the end of the post (or in the RSS feed), click 'Done', and then save your widget changes. When the page reloads, remove the widget from the sidebar and save the changes.

== Previous Updates ==

*Version: 1.1*
*Date: 2009-03-18*

* Date formatting: The widget now has an entry field for formatting the date display. Setting this to blank means no date will display.
